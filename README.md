# Foody App

This app is my final project for IOS Bootcamp. A simple food ordering app. User registers to the application with email and password. Login and register are provided with [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/). When logging on the application,firstly, the user sees food list(collectionview). Here, the photo, price, quantity and name of the food comes from the food api. I did data extraction from API with [Alomafire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire). I got the images from the API with the [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) package. The user can add the desired amount of food to his cart. The data in the basket belonging to that user are kept on the basket page. There is a food search feature on the homepage. And finally, we can see the email information in the user's account.
